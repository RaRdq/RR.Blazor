// RR.Blazor Dynamic Theme System
// Supports system theme detection and manual theme switching

// Default light theme variables in :root
@use 'default' as *;

// System theme auto-detection (when no data-theme attribute is present)
// Dark theme variables are forwarded when system prefers dark
@forward 'dark';

// Explicit light theme (when data-theme="light" is set)
[data-theme="light"] {
  // Light theme is already defined in :root, but explicitly set color-scheme
  color-scheme: light;
}

// Accessibility support moved to themes/_accessibility.scss

// Theme transition smoothing
html {
  transition: color-scheme 0.3s ease;
}

// Ensure proper theme inheritance
